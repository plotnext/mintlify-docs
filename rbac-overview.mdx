## Overview

The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system provides fine-grained authorization for the Arali platform. It currently implements a two-role system (Administrator and Member) with scoped permissions that can be applied at both enterprise-wide and organizational unit levels.

<Info>
**Key Principle**: The system checks **permissions**, not **roles**. Always verify specific permissions rather than role membership for authorization decisions.

## Architecture

The RBAC system consists of several key components:

## Key Concepts

### Permission-Based Authorization

Unlike traditional role-based systems, Arali's RBAC system focuses on **permissions** rather than roles. This means:

- Users are granted specific permissions through their roles
- Authorization checks verify permissions, not role membership
- This provides more granular control and flexibility

### Scoped Access Control

Permissions can be scoped at two levels:

- **Enterprise-wide**: Access across the entire organization
- **Org-unit specific**: Access limited to specific organizational units

### Role Hierarchy

Roles are organized by priority, with higher-priority roles able to assign lower-priority roles to users.

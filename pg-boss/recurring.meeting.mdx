# Recurring Meeting Sync API Documentation

This API handles the synchronization of recurring Google Calendar events for a user. It supports both **scan** and **sync** operations to keep recurring meetings up-to-date in your system.

## Job Registration

The recurring job handler (`recurring.meetings.scan` and `recurring.meetings.sync`) is responsible for periodically checking and syncing recurring events from Google Calendar.

## Job Flow

The flow for processing recurring meetings involves two main jobs:
1. **Recurring Scan Job (`recurring.meetings.scan`)** — Identifies rows in the database that need to be synced.
2. **Recurring Sync Job (`recurring.meetings.sync`)** — Fetches the recurring event instances from Google Calendar and posts them to your system.

<Step title="User Requests Resend">
  User provides their email address via this endpoint
</Step>

<Step title="Validation">
  System validates email exists and is unverified
</Step>

<Step title="Token Generation">
  A new magic verification token is generated with 15-minute expiry
</Step>

<Step title="Email Delivery">

</Step>

<Step title="User Clicks Link">
  User clicks the verification link in their email
</Step>

  User's email is marked as verified in the database
</Step>
</Steps>

## Email Template

The verification email includes:
- **Subject**: "Verify your email"
- **Content**: Clickable link to `/api/v1/auth/verify?token=<magic_token>`
- **Expiry**: Link expires in 15 minutes
- **Security**: One-time use token

## Rate Limiting

<Warning>
Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse of this endpoint. Users should not be able to request unlimited verification emails.
</Warning>

## Use Cases

- **Lost Email**: User didn't receive the original verification email
- **Expired Link**: Original verification link expired (15 minutes)
- **Wrong Email**: User entered wrong email during registration
- **Spam Filter**: Verification email was caught by spam filters

## Security Considerations

- Verification tokens expire in 15 minutes
- Tokens are single-use (consumed after verification)
- No sensitive information is exposed in error messages
- Email delivery status is tracked for debugging

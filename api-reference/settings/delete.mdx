## Security

<Warning>
Users can only delete settings that belong to their enterprise and their own user context. The API automatically enforces these constraints.
</Warning>

## Delete Behavior

- Only settings belonging to the authenticated user's enterprise and user ID can be deleted
- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- The operation is idempotent - attempting to delete a non-existent setting will return a 404 error

## Use Cases

- Remove user-specific preferences
- Clear enterprise-level configuration
- Reset to defaults by deleting custom settings
- Clean up old or unused settings
